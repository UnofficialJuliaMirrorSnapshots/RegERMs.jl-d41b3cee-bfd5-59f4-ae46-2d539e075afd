The following issues should be addressed (not ordered by priority):

- propagate kernel parameters
- cross-validation and use it if regularisation parameter is not provided
- sparse representation of data
- multiclass version
- documentation
- example weights
- feature weights / customized regularisation function (allow arbitrary covariance)
